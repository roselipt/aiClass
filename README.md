hw for Artificial Intelligence

May 2021: Hoping to use this repository to experiment with version control using Git and Github.
Couldn't get VSCode to work with Github, so I created this repo on Github and cloned locally.
Queens.py was the only one here at first.

I plan to continue writing code using Thonny as my professor has semi-required.
Goals are to:

    1. Write new programs for HW 5 & 6.
    
    2. Go back to complete 8-tiles game from HW 3.
    
    3. Move all earlier classwork here, organize and refactor.
